# Animal Name Generator

**Web**: [Animal Name Generator](https://chat-bot-eight-rust.vercel.app/)

## Overview

- This is a **Next.js** project deployed on **Vercel**.
- This web application is connected to the **OpenAI API**.
- The application allows users to generate a name and a photo for an animal by entering the animal's name (e.g., "dog" or "cat"). 
- I am using this project to test the OpenAI API. 
- This is a basic structure, and you can easily change the API commands to make the OpenAI API perform other tasks.
